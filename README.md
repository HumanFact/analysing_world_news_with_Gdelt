### Socioeconomic Portrait Project. A Google Cloud ETL.

Is there a way of monitoring some aspects of the global crisis in Spain? I believe so, and this is the motivation to develop this automated **ETL** process in **Google Cloud** involving **Google Trends**, sentiment analysis and influence in news through **the Gdelt Project** and **Twitter**, from raw data acquisition to the final dashboard. Thanks to it, I have been fighting with credentials, permissions, storage locations, processing locations, 3rd party authentications, Cloud Functions, pipelines, trigger schedulers with different time format, Dataprep global updates, etc... And I learned a lot in the way, quaratine fun! :D

### Controversial public figures with Gdelt:

I like reading "alternative" sources, like reddit, *hackernews* or *meneame*, and once in a while I read some news about delicate matters involving the King Emeritus of Spain. This articles always express a deep frustration about how this news are not being published in his country.

So, the questons I am trying to answer are the following: 

Are the spanish news not publishing the same than the rest of world about the King Emeritus of Spain?

Do we have a method to impartially contrast it?
